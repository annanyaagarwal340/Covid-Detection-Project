# Covid-Detection-Project
1.Overview
The COVID-19 X-ray Detection Deep Learning Project is a solution designed to detect COVID-19 cases through X-ray images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze X-ray images and identify potential COVID-19 cases.

2.Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/covid-cxr-image-dataset-research). It consists of 536 Covid-19 images, and 668 Normal images.

3.Model
For model building we have used MobileNet V2.Next, we have added additional layers for customizin the model for our task.

4.Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 99.25% on the validation dataset.

5.Model Deployment
I have used tkinter for model deployment.
